Flexible contract updates with freezing of the previous version, progress preservation, achievements transfer, and a chronicle of all contract addresses starting from the genesis contract (similar to Bitcoin blocks). Seamless migration of the entire project to other, faster blockchains. Open-source frontend code.\\n\\nThe expansion of the universe limits us outward, but we are not yet limited in depth, as we haven\'t reached the bottom. Who knows how deep the rabbit hole goes, or if a bottom even exists. And while Elon Musk reaches beyond Earth to provide space for blockchain metagame servers, we are creating these metagames.\\n\\nWe believe that the blockchains of the future will unify all existing projects. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others will become part of something greater. That\'s why everything we do will be preserved for centuries, making it essential to leave guidance for future generations about how we pioneered this way.\\n\\nThis game, inspired by the brilliant automation game Factorio, already allows players to organize production and defense on a bare asteroid \u2014 and travel as far as possible into the metacosmos. The further you go, the harder it becomes, and the more meteorites strike your asteroid. The goal is to beat the current record and leave an indelible message in the blockchain chronicle for future conquerors of the metaverses. Only champions have access to writing in the chronicle \u2014 history is written by the victors. Or by hackers and those who find vulnerabilities \u2014 though they are unfairly left in the shadows of history, despite the fact that it\u2019s thanks to them that our internet is so secure today.\\n\\nFuture plans include expanding the asteroid, base-building, saving progress, more content, automation, and exciting new objectives.","GetKey":"Get a temporary test key","ang":"\u0421\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a"}')}}]);
